model teh relationship between age and parameters for alpha hat equations (mortality, fecundity, maturity)
step 1 - collect age structured data from cortes paper
step 2 - figure out what variables shoujld be included in model to make age/parameter ogives
step 3 - collect data on above variables eg temperature preference, phylogeny etc

get 5 species parameter tables from cortes paper at least
